Columbia University Engineering - Fintech module 13


## Usage

1) Prepare data for use in a neural network model
      -   Import CSV file
      -   Separate categorical variables from continuous variables

2) Compile and evaluate a binary classifiacation model
      -   Create a deep neural network assigning number of input features, layers, and neurons on each layer using Tensorflow’s Keras
      -   Compile and fit the model using the binary_crossentropy loss function, the adam optimizer, and the accuracy evaluation metric

3) Optimize neural network model:
      -   Generate alternate models to test the predictive strength of the core model.
      -   Assess the accuracy scores achieved by each model, compare the results.¶
